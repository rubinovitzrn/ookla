\usage{
get_performance_tiles(
  service = c("mobile", "fixed"),
  year,
  quarter,
  sf = FALSE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{service}{Either 'mobile' or 'fixed' depending on whether you want mobile network or fixed broadband data}

\item{year}{Numeric value indicating the year of the time period of interest (e.g., \code{2020})}

\item{quarter}{Numeric value indicating the quarter of interest (e.g., \code{2} for Q2)}

\item{sf}{Whether or not to return object as \code{sf} dataframe (default: \code{FALSE})}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to \code{\link[arrow:read_parquet]{arrow::read_parquet()}}}
}
\value{
A data frame or \code{sf} data frame with the following fields:
\itemize{
\item \code{avg_d_kbps}: The average download speed of all tests performed in the tile, represented in kilobits per second
\item \code{avg_u_kbps}: The average upload speed of all tests performed in the tile, represented in kilobits per second
\item \code{avg_lat_ms}: The average latency of all tests performed in the tile, represented in milliseconds
\item \code{tests}: The number of tests taken in the tile
\item \code{devices}: The number of unique devices contributing tests in the tile
\item \code{quadkey}: The quadkey representing the tile. Quadkeys can act as a unique identifier for the tile.
\item \code{tile}: The WKT representation of tile geometry
}
}
\description{
\code{get_performance_tiles()} retrieves Ookla broadband performance data for a given quarter.
Data are grouped and summarized by \href{https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/bingmaps/articles/bing-maps-tile-system}{quadkey} using a zoom level of 16.
This equates to a tile that is approximately 610.8 meters by 610.8 meters at the equator (18 arcsecond blocks).

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Pulls all fixed broadband tiles from Q2 2020 and returns an `sf` data frame
get_performance_tiles(service = "fixed", year = 2020, quarter = 2, sf = TRUE)

# Get mobile quadkey and average download speeds for Q1 2020
get_performance_tiles(service = "mobile", year = 2020, quarter = 1, col_select = c("quadkey", "avg_d_kbps"))
}
